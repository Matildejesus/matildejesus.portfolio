          I'm Matilde, A graduate from the prestigious University of
          Melbourne, now embarking on another journey, through technology

          Just a girl who wants to create captivating apps, innovative websites,
          and immersive games of her own.

        <p class="info">
          Studying is more than just a task; it's a passion. Currently, I'm
          volunteering at STEM Sis, where I am developing an innovative app to
          support the SWOP SIS initiative, empowering women in professional
          environments with sustainable fashion solutions. This project aligns
          perfectly with my commitment to using technology for social good,
          bridging my technical skills with my dedication to meaningful,
          impactful work.

        <p class="subtitle">What I Did</p>
        <p class="info">
          Throughout my academic journey at University of Melbourne, I had the
          privilege of delving into both the design world and the world of code.
          From collaborating to create beautiful UI to mastering the inticacies
          of algorithms, I have learnt the power of collaboration, and
          relentless weeks of sitting on my ass and coding (which, believe it or
          not, i do enjoy).

      <div class="flex flex-col gap-2">
        <p class="subtitle">Why Am I Heading Down This Path</p>
        <p class="info">
          After 18 years of studying, the one thing that I've learnt is I hold a
          STRONG AVERSION for writing. I love how I can see my creations evolve
          in real time. Much like when I was engrossed with Sims4, creating and
          upgrading my houses as I go, programming offers a continuous sense of
          achievement. Every meticulous placement of an image, every command
          mastered, IT GIVES ME A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT.
